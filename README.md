Clothes Tracker

Clothes Tracker is a web app which allows users to view clothes to see attributes about the clothes, as well as who their owners and creators are. 

A user can see a list of all clothing items on one page, and can add new clothing if they so wish. On that same page, a user can also update any of the clothes within the page.

On another page a user can see a list of brands and add a new brand as well.
